- We have downloaded and kept the jenkins-cli jar file using
	wget http://localhost:8080/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar

- Now we will run the command to create and authenticate the admin user:
	java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ -auth @credentials.txt who-am-i
  credentials.txt has the username:password where the password is the one that jenkins gives us in the file:
	sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

- plugins cant be installed from cli, so I did it using the UI
